  <h2>Room Status - <strong>Occupied</strong></h2>
  <p>
    When a room is occupied, follow these guidelines to ensure the comfort and
    privacy of our guests:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Knock and announce yourself before entering the room.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Wait for a response before entering. If there is no response, knock
        again and announce yourself once more.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        If the guest is present, ask if it is a convenient time to clean the
        room or if they prefer you to return later.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Perform the cleaning tasks efficiently and quietly to minimize
        disruption.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>

        Ensure guest belongings are not disturbed and maintain their privacy at
        all times.

    </li>
